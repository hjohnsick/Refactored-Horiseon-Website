# Horiseon Website

## Description:
The Horiseon website was built using HTML and CSS.  It is a single page website that features a navigation bar with links to different sections of the page.  Additions have been made to improve the sites accessibility:
- Created a descriptive title.
- Added alternative text to images.
- Added semantic HTML elements.
- Fixed broken navigation link.

The CSS has also been consolidated by removing multiple classes with the same styles and combining them into one related class.  This eliminated code duplication, increased readability, and leads to cleaner code.

Working on this project, I learned about the importance of semantic HTML and how to use it.  This project taught me how to organize my code and make it more maintainable for myself and other developers working on it.
